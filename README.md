# Orderly

Flutter food delivery app scaffold (mocked) â€” a starter app implementing Splash, Onboarding, Auth, Home, Restaurant details, Cart & Checkout and Profile using Riverpod.

Getting started

1. Ensure Flutter is installed and available on your PATH.
2. From project root run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes
- Add image assets to `assets/images/` as referenced in `lib/data/mock_data.dart` (or update paths to network images).
- The project uses in-memory mock data and simple auth for demo purposes. Replace providers with real API clients when ready.
